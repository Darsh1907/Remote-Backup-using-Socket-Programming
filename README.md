# Remote-Backup-using-Socket-Programming
Remote Backup System using Socket Programming in Python

## Overview

Remote Backup is a simple Python-based system designed to facilitate the automated backup of files from a client machine to a remote server. This project aims to provide users with a straightforward solution for ensuring data safety by automating the backup process.

## Features

- **User Interface**: A simple web interface for uploading files to be backed up, using Streamlit.
- **Multi-device support**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit (for the client interface)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/Darsh1907/Remote-Backup-using-Socket-Programming.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory:
`cd Remote-Backup-using-Socket-Programming`

3. Install Streamlit (if not already installed):
`pip install streamlit`


### Running the Server

1. Navigate to the server directory:
`cd server`

2. Run the server script:
`python server.py`


### Running the Client

1. Navigate to the client directory:
`cd client`

2. Run the Streamlit app:
`streamlit run client.py`


## Usage

1. Open the client interface in your web browser.
2. Upload the file you wish to back up.
3. Optionally, choose to delete the file from your system after it has been backed up.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome!
